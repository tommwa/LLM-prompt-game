The data folder contains an english word frequency list taken from: https://github.com/IlyaSemenov/wikipedia-word-frequency/tree/master/results
This has the MIT license which has been put in a textfile data/LICENSE-dataset.txt within the data folder.
The word frequency list has been modified to only contain the 1000 most frequent words.

The code written by me has been put in the src folder and also has the MIT license which can be found under src/LICENSE-src.txt.
